# D12-s-Shoe-Store-WebSite
Website for a Digital and Physical Shoe Store created using Python, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Please note that the website is still under construction, and there are ongoing improvements to enhance the user experience.

Additionally, I want to clarify that names, titles, and products featured on the website are not utilized for profit.

Run The a.py file using VS Code or any other program, and with this activated, you will be able to access the HTML pages by copying/writing this IP adress (http://127.0.0.1:5000/) into your browser.
